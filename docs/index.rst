What is Aluminum?
=================

Aluminum is a lightweight web server written entirely in `Node.js <https://www.nodejs.org>`_, "an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime ... designed to build scalable network applications." It includes not only a traditional static file server, but also various other features that simplify the web development process, such as an authentication server and a network-based cryptography server.

Why Aluminum?
=============

Aluminum is simple to install and easy to use. Simply clone the git repository, install the dependencies automatically with ``yarn``, and copy the default configuration files into the higher level directory. Starting the web server is as simple as typing ``yarn run start`` into your terminal.

.. seealso:: See the installation guide for a detailed tutorial on getting started with Aluminum.

It also offers several unique and useful features:

* **Highly Customizable:** Use an official extension, a community-contributed one, or make your own.
* **Integrated Authentication Server:** Verify end users' identity without leaving the Aluminum platform.
* **PHP support:** If you're uncomfortable using Node.js for server-side scripting, Aluminum is also compatible with PHP.
* **And more:** Math rendering, network based time synchronization, simplified cryptography, etc.
